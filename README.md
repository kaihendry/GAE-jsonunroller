GAE-jsonunroller
================

## Weird things about GAE

* Expecting to just `git push` instead `goapp deploy` is weird Python and slow.
* [Dashboard](https://appengine.google.com/dashboard?&app_id=s~jsonunroller), lists lots of stuff IIUC I don't use, noisy
* Can't CNAME to jsonunroller.appspot.com ... LAME
* Logging methods are confusing
* Why can't I run my Web app without `goapp serve`!?
